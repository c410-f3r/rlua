# Builds the correct version of Lua 5.3 inside the crate. If you want to link a
# specialized version of lua into your binary, you can disable this feature to
# do that, but care must be taken.  `rlua` makes at least the following
# assumptions about the linked lua library:
#   * LUA_INTEGER is long long
#   * LUA_NUMBER as double
#   * LUA_EXTRASPACE is sizeof(void*)
#   * LUAI_MAXSTACK is 1000000
